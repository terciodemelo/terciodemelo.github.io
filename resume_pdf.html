I've started my professional career building backend systems in the mobile gaming industry, handling traffic of millions of players at the unicorn <a href="https://wildlifestudios.com">Wildlife Studios</a>. In the sequence I spent about an year as contractor stabilizing cloud infrastructure of growing companies in Silicon Valley and Brazil. Then I worked for three years in e-commerce, both being part of the launch of <a href="https://amazon.com.br/">Amazon.com.br</a> and building a serverless technology at the unicorn <a href="https://vtex.com/">VTEX</a> called VTEX IO. Now I am working at the Data division of the booming banking unicorn <a href="https://nubank.com.br/">Nubank</a>.</p><table class="education"><tr><td><h2>EDUCATION</h2><div class="experience"><span class="company">Universidade Federal de Campina Grande</span><br><span class="title">Computer Science</span><p class="period">2011 -
