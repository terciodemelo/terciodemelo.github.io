<head><link href="index.css?858.439509255018" rel="stylesheet" /></head><body><h1>Tercio de Melo</h1><p>New website is coming along!!</p><p>We now even have multiple paragraphs...</p><p>This website is made without any javascript.</p><p>Though the website itself is HTML and CSS only, it is generated from clojure code. I have previously used <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> to generate static website, but it is too cumbersome. I wanted something simple, but with powerful features such as hot reloading and custom logic for building the pages.</p><p>Of course a <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp">Lisp</a> would be the best tool for the job, code and data is the same, for being a homoiconic language; and <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is currently my flavor of Lisp.</p><p>Below is a snippet of the clojure code that for now generates this <code>index.html</code> file:</p><pre>(defn -main [& args]
  (with-open [wtr (io/writer "tercio.com.br/index.html")]
    (binding [*out* wtr]
      (println (html [:head
                      [:link {:rel "stylesheet" :href "index.css"}]
                      [:meta {:http-equiv "refresh"  :content "2"}]]
                     [:body (body)]
                     [:footer
                      [:span "2018-2021"]])))))
(-main)</pre><p>The <code>&lt;meta ...&gt;</code> tag triggers refresh every too second. And every time I save this file, it is executed by <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider">CIDER</a> and a new <code>index.html</code> is built.</p><p>Who already had some contact with <a href="ClojureScript"></a> might have noticed that I leverage <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a> to generate HTML from Clojure data structures. It is a really fun and powerful tool.</p><p>If you are intersted in seing the details, you will find the code in <a href="https://github.com/terciodemelo/terciodemelo.github.io">GitHub</a>. This website is hosted in <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.</p></body><footer><span>2018-2021</span></footer>
