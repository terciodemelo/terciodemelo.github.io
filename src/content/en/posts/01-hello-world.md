## What this IS NOT about
Hey there, it's nice to have you here. I have a somewhat broad range of interests that I'd like to talk about on the internet, but I think that not every place is suitable for anything. For one, I'm quite into politics, but I won't talk about it here, that's for Facebook ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. So, if you know me personally, rest assured I will not talk about politics in this website. I won't talk about personal matters, culture, travels, etc.

## What this is about
This blog is intended for professional subjects only. At least for now I believe that I will be talking mostly about tooling, distributed systems, computer networking, and technology in general. I plan to develop some series of blog posts: one-day builds, diving deep on technologies we take for granted, insights, small efforts for big gains, among others that will certainly come up along the way.

## Side effects
Another outcome I expect with this platform is developing the habit of writing frequently. I'm writing a short stories series that may or may not become a book, another blog, comics, or nothing. To make the most out of this process I need to practice writing other subjects. The only kind of writing I've been doing in the past years have been commit messages and written communication with friends, family and co-workers; which are no good when you want to write essays or books.

If I focused only on writing these short stories, I wouldn't be able to give them the quality they need. I must exercise writing extensively about multiple subjects to strengthen a long tail of abilities that will empower me to better handle edge cases on such my stories.

## On the post frequency
I'm not sure yet. As I write this post I'm on vacations, locked in home because of the COVID-19 pandemic; thus I'm quite free. What I want, though, is to have at least one new blog post a week. I believe that there will be times I will write multiple articles at once, and there will be hiatus in which I either will not have enough time to write, or may just won't feel like writing; we're gonna have to wait to see.

## English only?
Yes, probably. I have the option for internationalization, and I could at least translate the articles to Portuguese; my native language. But translation is a pain, a very time consuming activity that usually takes from me all the joy of writing. Perhaps as I develop this blogging habit translation will become easier. But I don't make any promises.

## Is that all?
I think so, for now. I'm tagging this article `announcement`, if you are interested in more like this, click on the tag just below the title. See ya!
