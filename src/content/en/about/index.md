Hi, I'm Tercio, and I'm a software engineer currently located in the worderful city of Rio de Janeiro. Currently I fill the role of Site Reliability Engineer at [VTEX](https://vtex.com) working with workload orchestration, logging, automation, dev tooling, monitoring, database, load testing, and all that fun stuff that product developers usually don't wanna touch. 

This website has an evolving purpose of being my personal presentation to the world, containing a blog, my personal projects, and whatever else comes to fit here in the future.
