I'm employed by <a href="https://nubank.com.br/" style="color:rgb(138, 5, 190);font-weight:bold;">Nubank</a> as a Systems Engineer at the Data Access team. In my time I've been mostly working in a middle ground area of software engineering and systems administration. My main interests are distributed systems and systems programming, so there you go; though I like pretty things.</p><h2>Contact</h2><p>If you wanna talk to me, feel free to reach me via <a href="mailto:contact@tercio.com.br">contact@tercio.com.br</a>. You may also follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/terciodemelo">Twitter</a>, even though I'm not actually active there, and as Brazil is bursting into fascist flames I mostly retweet politics. You will also find me at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tercio-de-melo/">LinkedIn</a>, but it is just a resumé hosting platform to me. The truth is that I'm not very much engaged to social media anymore. I'm tired and bored by it; and have also been trying to dodge corporate spying one step at a time.</p></body></body></html>
