[{"content":"What this IS NOT about Hey there, it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have you here. I have a somewhat broad range of interests that I\u0026rsquo;d like to talk about on the internet, but I think that not every place is suitable for anything. For one, I\u0026rsquo;m quite into politics, but I won\u0026rsquo;t talk about it here, that\u0026rsquo;s for Facebook ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. So, if you know me personally, rest assured I will not talk about politics in this website. I won\u0026rsquo;t talk about personal matters, culture, travels, etc.\nWhat this is about This blog is intended for professional subjects only. At least for now I believe that I will be talking mostly about tooling, distributed systems, computer networking, and technology in general. I plan to develop some series of blog posts: one-day builds, diving deep on technologies we take for granted, insights, small efforts for big gains, among others that will certainly come up along the way.\nSide effects Another outcome I expect with this platform is developing the habit of writing frequently. I\u0026rsquo;m writing a short stories series that may or may not become a book, another blog, comics, or nothing. To make the most out of this process I need to practice writing other subjects. The only kind of writing I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing in the past years have been commit messages and written communication with friends, family and co-workers; which are no good when you want to write essays or books.\nIf I focused only on writing these short stories, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to give them the quality they need. I must exercise writing extensively about multiple subjects to strengthen a long tail of abilities that will empower me to better handle edge cases on such my stories.\nOn the post frequency I\u0026rsquo;m not sure yet. As I write this post I\u0026rsquo;m on vacations, locked in home because of the COVID-19 pandemic; thus I\u0026rsquo;m quite free. What I want, though, is to have at least one new blog post a week. I believe that there will be times I will write multiple articles at once, and there will be hiatus in which I either will not have enough time to write, or may just won\u0026rsquo;t feel like writing; we\u0026rsquo;re gonna have to wait to see.\nEnglish only? Yes, probably. I have the option for internationalization, and I could at least translate the articles to Portuguese; my native language. But translation is a pain, a very time consuming activity that usually takes from me all the joy of writing. Perhaps as I develop this blogging habit translation will become easier. But I don\u0026rsquo;t make any promises.\nIs that all? I think so, for now.
